### Jess Web Application

In order to make the application run, first extract the zips from the deps folder.

- After extracting them, unarchive the contents of the jess/eclipse folder in it and copy the two resulting folders "plugins" and "features" into the root of your Eclipse folder.

- Open the project in eclipse and link the tomcat folder you extracted as a server as well as the jess jar from the folder.
- A tutorial should be written on how to do everything nicely and set it up.
Run the application and enjoy.
